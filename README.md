# WBCD Machine Learning Showcase

This project aims to be as educational and detailed as possible to showcase my understanding and proficiency of [the R programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and the topics at hand: [data science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science) (exploration, visualization, PCA...) and [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (through several high level libraries).  
Note that the R Markdown file outputs a .HTML document that has been [uplodad to RPubs](https://rpubs.com/outerelocarlos/WBCD-Machine-Learning-Showcase) where it can be properly visualized. Both files are also available in their dedicated [GitHub repository](https://rpubs.com/outerelocarlos/WBCD-Machine-Learning-Showcase).<br>

The goal of this project is to perform a complete exploratory data analysis upon the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset describing and detailing each step of the process. The document and its content are heavily based upon the work of [Miri Choi in kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/classification-breast-cancer-or-not-with-15-ml/report "[Classification] Breast Cancer or Not") although with a much larger scope, much more detail (throughfully commenting each step of the process) and further developed (using additional machine learning libraries and approaches).

* The [R Markdown file](./WBCD-Machine-Learning-Showcase.Rmd) where the exploratory data analysis is throughfully documented.

* An [HTML file](./WBCD-Machine-Learning-Showcase.html) knitted by the R Markdown file. It has been [uplodad to RPubs](https://rpubs.com/outerelocarlos/WBCD-Machine-Learning-Showcase) where it can be properly visualized.
